I am usually found to be quite friendly, and only rarely have been known to gank people in Warcraft.
Please don't hesitate to contact me for questions on items not found in the manuals or code.

The following people helped in the creation of this kit:
Ivo Grigull (monkeyloo@gmx.net) helped code the Blender 3d exporter for Diff Maps.  His webpage can be found at http://ivogrigull.com/
Jon Himoff of Rezzable.com is my employer, and was kind enough to let this project go public domain.
Ordinal, LittleToe, and Pavig:  thanks for your thoughts on the API and features.  It actually has most of them!
Botany Black (Rebecca Bowden), for feeding and watering me when I was in a coding trance and not letting me just fade away.
Ton Roosendaal of Blender fame.  Thanks for the first, and BEST tool I've ever used on a computer.  You rock, dude.
Caitlyn Meeks of Unity3d.  Thanks for your thoughts and comments!
The programming team at Unity3d.  You know, builtin arrays in javascript?  I like those.  Here you go.  Have Morph shapes back in exchange!
Jonathan Coulton for the song "I'm Your Moon".  Nice work, dude!
