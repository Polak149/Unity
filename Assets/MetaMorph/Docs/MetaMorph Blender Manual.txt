Diff Maps are used by the MetaMorph engine for Unity3d.  They allow Shapekeys to be exported to Unity3d and used to animate shapechanges in a mesh.
MetaMorph can be used in additon (and at the same time as) bones in unity, allowing the most detailed animation in Unity to date.

Examples of use:
Facial animation and speech mouth morphs (even with a jaw-bone)
Having one main humanoid mesh, and using shapekeys to change it from male, female, and neuter versions.
Using it for complex mesh animations, such as melting, exploding, and the like.

About DiffMaps and UV layers/unwrapping:
Diffmaps store data like normal maps, that means that overlapping faces/uvs disrupt the data stored on them and will lead to distortions of the diffmap.
Verts on the UV later need to be fare enough apart that they can store color(position) data in the pixel they are over, without another pixel disruping it.
If you model has to have overlapping uvs for the texture work, then use the second UV layer for the diff-map and make a unique unwrap of the mesh.
Unity3d can ONLY use TWO UV layers.  


Install blender 2.5
Drop the "io_export_diffmap.py" into your addons directory
Activate the plugin in the Add-Ons menu under Import-Export


Select the Mesh you want to export ShapeKeys from
In the Properties window, select the Object Data tab
You will find the Diff-Map Exporter


You have the following settings:
File path:  This is where all the files will be exported.  
Name:  This is the prefix for the name of all files exported.  They will have other information appended aftter it.
Width:  The Diff-Map texture Width.  Depending on your mesh complexity, make this as small as possible to reduce filesize.
Height:  The Diff-Map texture Width.  Depending on your mesh complexity, make this as small as possible to reduce filesize.
Edge Margin:  When baking texture onto a UV mesh, you can choose how far out the margins along the UV edges spread.
UV Texture Layer Selection:  You can have more than one UV layer, and sometimes, you may want to use a special UV layer for Diff-Maps than for texturing.  Since you can't have overlapping UV mappings in a mesh that uses a diffmap, you might make uv layer one your texture layer, and UV layer two your Diffmap layer.  This is something like having a layer for textures and a layer for lightmaps.
Export ShapeKeys:  Checking this allows you to export the diffmaps as TGA images. 
Export Animations:  Checking this exports the animation text file. 
Export Diff v.x.x.x: Click this to export the data into the folder you have selected.


All of the ShapeKeys will be output as TGA textures, with the filename [Name]-[ShapeKey name].TGA
The TGA files are Diff Maps.  Like Normal Maps, these textures store data in their RGB colors.

The data stored is the normalized xyz shift of each vert into a RGB color.
Red Channel 0-255 = -1 to 1 x shift.  This makes 128 = 0 shift.
Green Channel 0-255 = -1 to 1 y shift.
Blue Channel 0-255 = -1 to 1 z shift.


Animations are saved as [Name]-[startframe]to[endframe]-DiffMapAnimation.TXT
This is a text file much like a BVH animation file, except for storing ShapeKey animation data.
Is is an export of all the ShapeKey values for each frame from your timeline Start to End values.
If you want to export more than one animation, checkbox the "Animation Only" option in the exporter to prevent exporting all the textures again.


These files are usable MetaMorph for Unity 3D, allowing game use of ShapeKeys in your Unity games.


MetaMorph is a Mesh shape API for game designers.  It allows ShapeKey animation work a direct pipeline into Unity, putting mesh animation fully into the hands of the animators, but allowing programmers detailed control over how to use it.


All sourcecode for the exporter and Importers are included with the attached MetaMorph Animation Kit, so please feel free to examine it for a better idea of DiffMap and DiffMap animation file format.
